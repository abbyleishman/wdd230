            <p class="info">White space draws attention and empasis to what is on the page. This page does a great job
                showing this with the use of empty space and simplicity in the design. It is very clear to see what the 
                website is about becuase there is nothing to distract from it. There is breathing room and it is easy on the eyes.

            <img class="visual_hierarchy" src="images/wdd230_visual_heirarchy.png" alt="visual hierarchy">
            <p class="info">When you first click on this site it is very clear what they want you to focus on. They place
                the image of the girl front and center so that is what your eyes go to first. Then, you eyes can trail to 
                her name and what the site is about. The main purpse of the site is to tell about the girl, which is why she
                is the highest on the visual heirarchy.

            <img class="colors" src="images/wdd230_colors.png" alt="contrast">
            <p class="info">This site is a great example of contrast. The blue and orange are opposite each other on
                the color wheel, but they are muted to help relieve the harshness of the contrast. It really makes
                the text and image pop against the background so that you are more interested in the content.
